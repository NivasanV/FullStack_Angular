Steps we have followed to deploy any application:
 
1. Download appropriate JDK
2. Download appropriate Spring Version
3. Download appropriate hibernate version(make sure that hibernate
and Spring version we are using are compatible with each other)
4. Download appropriate Tomcat version (make sure that tomcat version,
jdk version, framework version are compatible with each other. 
5. Write configuration files in Spring. 
6. Start tomcat and deploy applications on tomcat.

  -Spring is evolved over aperiod of time and offering a lot of fearture to use
   to use this feature we need to write lot of configuration
  -This can be overbelming for the begineer and repeatative for expericend
   hence spring team hase come up with new project known as springboot

1. spring boot gives us lot of auto configuration
2. springboot give us opinionated statrt POM.xml(hence we dont worry about versions)
3. embedded container(no need to sperately download tomcat and run)
4. spring boot can gives us production ready application
5. it saves lot of development ready
